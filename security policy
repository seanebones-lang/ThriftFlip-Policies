# ThriftFlip Security Policy

**Last Updated: November 10, 2025**

NextEleven Studios ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the security of ThriftFlip and our users' data. This Security Policy outlines our security measures, practices, and procedures for maintaining the security and integrity of the ThriftFlip mobile application.

## 1. Security Overview

ThriftFlip is designed with security and privacy as fundamental principles. We implement multiple layers of security to protect user data and ensure the app's secure operation.

### Security Principles

- **Privacy by Design**: Data is stored locally on user devices, minimizing exposure
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against threats
- **Least Privilege**: App requests only necessary permissions
- **Secure by Default**: Security measures are enabled by default
- **Transparency**: We are transparent about our security practices

## 2. Data Protection

### Local Data Storage

- **Storage Location**: All user data (flip records, watchlist items, preferences) is stored locally on the user's device using Apple's SwiftData framework
- **No Cloud Storage**: We do not store user data on our servers, eliminating server-side data breach risks
- **Device Encryption**: Data stored locally is protected by iOS's built-in encryption (Data Protection API)
- **Keychain Storage**: Sensitive data (if any) is stored in iOS Keychain with appropriate protection classes

### Data Encryption

- **At Rest**: Data stored on device is encrypted using iOS's Data Protection API
- **In Transit**: All network communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Image Processing**: Images are processed locally on device and never transmitted to our servers
- **API Communications**: All API requests use HTTPS encryption

### Data Access Control

- **User Control**: Users have full control over their data
- **No Backend Access**: We do not have backend access to user data
- **Permission-Based**: App requests permissions only when needed
- **User Deletion**: Users can delete all data by deleting the app

## 3. API Security

### Secure Communication

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- **Certificate Validation**: API endpoints use valid SSL certificates
- **Secure URLs**: All URLs are validated and converted to HTTPS when possible
- **No HTTP**: HTTP connections are automatically upgraded to HTTPS

### API Key Management

- **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored securely and not hardcoded in production
- **Environment Variables**: API keys are loaded from environment variables or secure configuration
- **Key Rotation**: API keys can be rotated without app updates
- **No Exposure**: API keys are never exposed in logs, error messages, or client-side code

### API Request Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before sending to APIs
- **Rate Limiting**: API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: Error messages do not expose sensitive information
- **Timeout Handling**: API requests have appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging connections

### Third-Party API Security

- **Vetted Providers**: We only use reputable, vetted third-party API providers
- **API Contracts**: We use official API contracts and documentation
- **Data Minimization**: We send only necessary data to APIs (no personal information)
- **Privacy Policies**: All third-party APIs have published privacy policies

## 4. Authentication & Authorization

### Subscription Authentication

- **StoreKit 2**: Subscription authentication uses Apple's StoreKit 2 framework
- **Transaction Verification**: All transactions are cryptographically verified
- **Receipt Validation**: Subscription receipts are validated through Apple's servers
- **No Credentials**: We do not store or process payment credentials

### Permission Management

- **On-Demand Requests**: Permissions are requested only when needed
- **User Control**: Users can grant or revoke permissions at any time
- **Graceful Degradation**: App functions with limited features if permissions are denied
- **Clear Messaging**: Permission requests include clear explanations of why access is needed

### Authorization Checks

- **Subscription Status**: Subscription status is verified before granting access to premium features
- **Local Verification**: Subscription status is verified locally using StoreKit
- **Real-Time Updates**: Subscription status is updated in real-time
- **Secure Storage**: Subscription status is stored securely on device

## 5. Code Security

### Secure Coding Practices

- **Type Safety**: Code uses Swift's type system to prevent type-related vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- **No Eval**: No dynamic code execution or eval() functions
- **Memory Safety**: Swift's memory safety features prevent buffer overflows

### Code Review

- **Peer Review**: Code changes are reviewed before deployment
- **Security Review**: Security-sensitive code receives additional review
- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities

### Secure Configuration

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys, passwords, or secrets hardcoded in source code
- **Environment Configuration**: Configuration is loaded from environment variables
- **Secure Defaults**: Security features are enabled by default
- **Configuration Validation**: Configuration is validated at startup

## 6. Network Security

### HTTPS Enforcement

- **TLS 1.2+**: All network communications use TLS 1.2 or higher
- **Certificate Validation**: SSL certificates are validated for all connections
- **HTTP Upgrade**: HTTP URLs are automatically upgraded to HTTPS
- **Secure Redirects**: Secure redirects are used when necessary

### Network Request Security

- **URL Validation**: All URLs are validated before use
- **Query Parameter Sanitization**: Query parameters are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Header Security**: Security headers are included in API requests
- **Request Timeouts**: All requests have appropriate timeouts

### Network Monitoring
