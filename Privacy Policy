# ThriftFlip Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 10, 2025**

NextEleven Studios ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard your information when you use the **ThriftFlip** mobile application ("ThriftFlip" or the "App") available on iOS devices through the Apple App Store. By using ThriftFlip, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

ThriftFlip is designed to help users identify, evaluate, and resell items using barcode scanning, AI-powered photo recognition, and multi-marketplace price comparison. We prioritize your privacy and store all data locally on your device.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. Information You Provide

- **User Content**: Information you input into the app, such as:
  - Product purchase costs
  - Flip records (purchase dates, sale dates, notes)
  - Watchlist items and price alerts
  - App preferences and settings

- **Subscription Data**: If you subscribe to ThriftFlip Pro, billing information is processed entirely through Apple's in-app purchase system (StoreKit). We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or billing address. All subscription transactions are handled by Apple.

### b. Information Collected Automatically

- **Device Information**: Limited device information may be collected through Apple's systems (operating system version, device type) for app functionality and crash reporting. This information is anonymized and used only for app improvement.

- **Camera and Photo Library**: With your explicit permission, we access your device's camera for barcode scanning and photo capture, and your photo library for selecting images. Images are processed locally on your device using Apple's Vision Framework and are never uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties.

### c. Information from Third-Party Services

- **Product Lookup Services**: When you scan a barcode, we may query third-party product databases (UPCItemDB, Barcode Lookup API, OpenFoodFacts) to retrieve product information. These queries include only the barcode number and do not include any personal information.

- **Marketplace APIs**: When you search for product prices, we query marketplace APIs (eBay, Amazon, Mercari, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace) to retrieve publicly available listing information. These queries include only product identifiers (barcodes, product names, categories) and do not include any personal information.

### d. Data We Do NOT Collect

We do NOT collect:
- Personal identifying information (name, email, address)
- Account information (the app does not require user accounts)
- Location data
- Contact information
- Biometric data
- Health information
- Financial information beyond what Apple processes for subscriptions
- Advertising identifiers for tracking
- Analytics data for marketing purposes

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely to:

- **Provide Core Features**: Enable barcode scanning, AI-powered product recognition, price comparison, and flip tracking functionality.

- **Improve the App**: Use anonymized crash reports and usage data (provided by Apple) to fix bugs and improve app performance.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

**We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.**
